To run use the Driver.py file 
For A* heuristic use 1 command flag 
For random heuristic use 0 command flag 
NOTE: This program will only run if the text file does not have extra spaces in it 

The Random Heuristic randomly chooses a number underneath the shortest path between your location and the destination.

The equation utilizes a random number generator that chooses a random number underneath the shortest linear distance to the destination 

I chose this heuristic because I thought it might achieve a unexpectedly positive result similar to the result that random sort is able to achieve 

I was wrong........
Because the random heuristic is random it does not produce a consistent result. The results of this heuristic eventualy finds the same path
as the a* one however, with around 200-300 more evaluations.
